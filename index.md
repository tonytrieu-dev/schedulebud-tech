## Calendar Navigation Mastery

I used to be one of those people who just stayed in month view all the time. Big mistake! ScheduleBud's navigation is actually pretty clever once you know what you're doing.

### Navigation Shortcuts You Might Be Missing

See those little controls in the top-left? Yeah, those are more useful than they look:

*   **Arrow Buttons:** Click left/right to jump around. Works in any view‚Äîmonth, week, or day.
*   **View Buttons:** Honestly, this is where the magic happens. One click switches your whole perspective.

### Switch Views Based on Your Workload

Here's what I've learned about when to use each view:

**Month View** is your bird's-eye view
- Perfect when you're planning ahead or trying to spot those awful weeks where everything's due at once
- I always start here when uploading a new syllabus

**Week View** is where I live during busy periods
- This is your go-to during midterms and finals
- Great for time blocking and seeing how your week actually flows

**Day View** is for when things get intense
- Multiple deadlines? Day view.
- Need to plan your study sessions hour by hour? Day view.
- It's like having a microscope for your schedule

### My Go-To Workflow

This might sound obsessive, but I switch views constantly:

1.  Start in **Month View** to see the big picture
2.  Zoom into **Week View** to plan out my week
3.  Drop down to **Day View** when I need to get granular

I probably switch views 3-4 times every time I open ScheduleBud. Once you get used to it, it's second nature.

## Bulk Task Creator

Okay, this one's a game-changer. I used to sit there creating tasks one by one like some kind of caveman. Then I discovered the Bulk Task Creator and suddenly I'm adding entire assignment sets in like 30 seconds.

### When to Use It
Anytime you're facing a bunch of similar tasks. Weekly homework, project milestones, those annoying recurring assignments‚Äîyou know the drill.

### Here's How It Works

1. **Find the üìã Button**: It's right there in your calendar header‚Äîsays "Bulk Add"
2. **Set the Basics**: Pick your class and task type once
3. **Rapid Fire**: Just type titles and dates
4. **It Remembers**: ScheduleBud actually remembers what you did last time, which is nice

### Tips That Actually Matter

**Keep Your Naming Simple**:
- "HW 1", "HW 2", "HW 3" (don't be fancy‚Äî"Homework Assignment Number One" is just painful)
- "Quiz Ch 1", "Quiz Ch 2" (stick to patterns)

**Group Similar Stuff**:
- Do all your homework for one class at once
- Batch your reading assignments
- Project milestones work great together

**Let It Help You**:
- Set your class and type first‚Äîit applies to everything
- The due time carries over, which is perfect for those classes where everything's due at 11:59 PM
- It remembers your task types for next time

### Real Example

Last week I had to add a bunch of CS assignments:
1. Clicked üìã Bulk Add
2. Set it to "Computer Science" and "Homework"
3. Typed: "HW 3", "HW 4", "Lab 2", "Reading Ch 5"
4. Set the dates and hit Create All

Boom. Four tasks in maybe 20 seconds. Would've taken me 2-3 minutes doing them one by one.

Honestly, for multiple assignments, this saves me <span class="highlight-orange">way more time than it should</span>.

## Customize Your Navigation Bar

Here's something most people don't realize: you can actually rearrange your navigation bar. I know, mind-blowing stuff.

### Make It Work for You

Just drag and drop your favorite views to the front. I'm a visual person, so I keep **Calendar** first. But if you're more of a list person who practically lives in **Tasks**, move that up front.

**The best part?** <span class="highlight-blue">You can change this whenever you want</span>. I've probably rearranged mine three times this semester as my workflow changed.

## Quick Add vs Regular Add

So ScheduleBud gives you two ways to create tasks, and honestly, knowing when to use which one makes a huge difference.

### ‚ö° Quick Add: For When You're Moving Fast

**I use this for**:
- Basic homework (you know, the usual stuff)
- Reading assignments
- Simple deadlines
- When I'm in a rush and just need to capture everything

**Where to find it**: That <span class="highlight-orange">‚ö° lightning bolt</span> in your calendar header

**What you get**:
- Task title
- Due date
- Class selection
- Everything else gets sensible defaults

**Why it's great**: <span class="highlight-green">Way faster than the full thing</span>‚Äîlike 60% faster

### üìù Regular Add: For the Complex Stuff

**I switch to this when**:
- I've got a complex project with lots of moving pieces
- It's time-specific (like a presentation at 2:30 PM)
- I need to add notes or descriptions
- Canvas sync is being weird and needs customization

**How to get there**: Click the "+" button for the full modal

**What you get**:
- Everything from Quick Add, plus:
- Specific times (start, end, duration)
- Description fields
- Custom task types
- Canvas integration controls

### Which One Should You Use?

**Go with Quick Add when**:
- ‚úÖ It's just regular homework
- ‚úÖ 11:59 PM deadline works (which, let's be honest, is most of the time)
- ‚úÖ You don't need notes
- ‚úÖ You're adding a bunch of simple stuff

**Use Regular Add when**:
- ‚úÖ You need a specific time (like that dreaded 8 AM presentation)
- ‚úÖ Duration actually matters (3-hour exams, ugh)
- ‚úÖ You need to write yourself notes
- ‚úÖ Canvas is being Canvas and you need to fix something

### My Strategy

**Most of the time, I use Quick Add**
- I capture about 80% of my tasks this way
- Get everything in first, worry about details later

**The defaults actually work**:
- It remembers which class I picked last time
- Task types are usually right
- 11:59 PM is perfect for most assignments

**My "capture then refine" approach**:
- Quick Add during those frantic planning sessions
- Go back later to add details to the important stuff
- Best of both worlds‚Äînothing falls through the cracks

**For example**:
- Quick Add: "Math HW 5", "Read Ch 3", "Discussion Post"
- Regular Add: "Final Presentation" (because I need to block out that specific time)

This way I capture everything fast but still plan the complex stuff properly.

## Calendar Controls Settings

So those calendar controls? You can actually customize how they work. I had no idea for the longest time.

### What We're Talking About

**View Buttons**: Those Month/Week/Day switchers
**Navigation Arrows**: The previous/next buttons
**Quick Actions**: Your ‚ö° Quick Add and üìã Bulk Add buttons

**By default**: They show up when you hover (keeps things clean)
**But you can change it**: Make them always visible if you want

### Always-Visible vs. Hover-Only
*   **Always-Visible:** I switched to this because I got tired of hunting for buttons. Great if you have a bigger screen.
*   **Hover-Only:** Cleaner look, but sometimes I forget where things are.

Just go to **Settings > Calendar Preferences** if you want to mess with this.

## Task Completion Shortcuts

Completing tasks isn't just about checkboxes. There are some neat shortcuts that make the whole process way more satisfying.

### Making It Feel Good
*   **Quick-click** anywhere on the left side of a task. Done.
*   I love how completed tasks get that **strikethrough** and fade out‚Äîmakes it super clear what's finished.
*   **Check things off as you go**. Trust me, it builds momentum and keeps your list from getting overwhelming.

### What the Different States Mean

**Active Tasks**: Normal looking, ready to tackle
**Completed Tasks**: Strikethrough and faded (but you can still see them)
**Overdue Tasks**: Get highlighted so they're impossible to ignore

**My approach**: I check things off as soon as I'm done. Keeps the active list clean and honestly, it just feels good.

## Dark Mode & Theme Customization

Okay, let's talk themes. ScheduleBud looks good in both light and dark mode, and switching between them actually makes more of a difference than you'd think.

### Why Dark Mode Is Actually Great

**For those late-night cram sessions**:
- Way easier on your eyes when the lights are dim
- Less blue light (which is supposedly better for sleep, though let's be honest, we're probably up late anyway)
- Saves battery on laptops

**Helps you focus**:
- Dark backgrounds are less distracting
- Your tasks really pop
- Calendar events are easier to spot

**Looks professional**:
- Modern and clean
- Perfect when you're screen sharing
- Matches most other apps you're probably using

### When I Use Each Theme

**Light Mode**:
- Daytime work, especially when there's good natural light
- When I'm reading a lot (somehow easier on my eyes)
- Screen sharing with people who might find dark mode jarring

**Dark Mode**:
- Evening work (pretty much my default after 6 PM)
- Long study sessions
- When I want to reduce eye strain

**Fun fact**: Some people actually switch automatically based on time of day. I just pick one and stick with it for weeks at a time.

### How to Switch

1. **Settings Menu**: Hit that gear icon
2. **Appearance Section**: Theme options are right there
3. **Instant**: Changes happen immediately
4. **System Sync**: You can set it to follow whatever your computer is doing

### My Take on Choosing

**Try both for different types of work**:
- I use light mode when I'm doing a lot of reading
- Dark mode for planning and task management

**Think about your setup**:
- Match your lighting situation
- Consider what other apps you're using
- Remember if you share your screen a lot

**Honestly, it's personal**:
- Some people are just light mode people, others are dark mode people
- Try each for a few days
- Go with whatever doesn't make you squint

### Getting Fancy With It

**Some people get really into theme workflows**:
- Light mode for morning planning sessions
- Dark mode for evening reviews
- It's like visual cues for different types of work

**Consistency matters**:
- Match your computer's theme
- Coordinate with your other apps
- Less jarring when switching between things

**Bottom line**: Pick whatever doesn't strain your eyes. The best theme is the one that lets you work longer without getting tired.

## Sidebar Customization

Here's something I wish I'd known earlier: you can resize the sidebar. Sounds simple, but it actually makes a big difference depending on your setup.

### Why This Actually Matters

**Narrow sidebar (the default)**:
- More room for your actual calendar
- Works well on smaller screens
- Less visual clutter

**Wide sidebar**:
- You can actually read your full class names
- Easier to click on things
- Better if you have long course names (looking at you, "Organic Chemistry Laboratory")

### How to Do It

**Just drag**: Look for the resize handle on the right edge of the sidebar
**You'll see a preview**: Shows you what it'll look like as you drag
**It remembers**: Your preferred width gets saved
**It has limits**: Can't make it so narrow or wide that it becomes useless

### What Width Works When

**Got long course names?** Go wider
- "Introduction to Statistics for Business"
- "Organic Chemistry Laboratory"
- "History of Western Civilization"
- You know the type

**Taking a lot of classes?** Medium width works well
- 5+ classes and you'll want to read the names without squinting
- Saves you from constantly scrolling

**Simple setup?** Keep it narrow
- Short names like "Math", "CS", "Bio"
- Only 3-4 classes
- Big monitor and you want to focus on the calendar

### Organization Tips

**Order matters**:
- Put your most-used classes at the top
- I go by priority, but alphabetical works too
- Drop finished classes as the semester goes on

**Make scanning easy**:
- Wider sidebar = you find classes faster
- Keep things in the same spots
- The color coding actually helps more than you'd think

### My Recommendations

**Based on your screen**:
- **Big monitors (24"+)**: Go wider, you've got the real estate
- **Laptop**: Medium width usually hits the sweet spot
- **Small screen**: Keep it narrow, you need every pixel for content

**Based on how you work**:
- **Always switching classes**: Wider makes clicking easier
- **Live in calendar view**: Narrower gives you more calendar space
- **Bit of both**: Medium width is probably your friend

**Honestly, just experiment**:
- Try wide for a week
- Try narrow for a week
- You'll know what feels right

**The best sidebar is the one you don't think about**‚Äîit just works for how you actually use ScheduleBud.
